Sometimes you need to show part of your screen to somebody (for example to explain).

**Skitchy** is a desktop application that allows to take a screenshot of a part of the screen. Next, you can edit the screenshot:

- crop
- add some text
- free draw
- add some basic shapes

Then you can export your edited image to png.
